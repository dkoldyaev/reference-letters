From 2021 to 2022, Dmitry worked as a frontend developer in our Tender team, where he was responsible for developing and maintaining our services.

The most significant project he contributed to was the design and launch of an internal CRM system for providing loans to clients through intermediary banks. The development took about a year and included integrating the business processes of partner banks into our system.

Even during the prototyping phase, the system significantly improved and accelerated the managers' workflow. Each sprint delivered new enhancements that were implemented based on the real needs of users. The final version of the system reduced the time managers spent processing client applications by a factor of eight. Later, this system became the foundation for developing admin panels for other services and teams.

In addition, Dmitry was involved in maintaining and improving the services under our team’s responsibility: fixing bugs, refining features, and ensuring their stable operation.

Dmitry didn’t just complete tasks—he actively participated in discussions and contributed to solutions that genuinely improved processes. His approach to work set a high standard of quality and consistently delivered tangible results.
