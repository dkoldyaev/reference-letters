Since October 2022, Dmitry has been working as a front-end developer at Pinsteps, where he contributes to the development of a website constructor for municipal governments.

Dmitry has been involved in the development of all key parts of our product:

He built a CMS for website configuration from scratch. One of its most important features is a visual page constructor, which allows users to design and customize web content without involving developers.

He also created a component library for the constructor. The library was designed with dependency management and version control for each package, ensuring ease of updates and system scalability.

Notably, Dmitry developed a prototype of the client website for the municipality of Haifa in just three months. This website became a critical tool for showcasing the product to potential investors.

Dmitry has demonstrated a high level of independence, taking full ownership of all stages of development. His approach has ensured reliability and predictability in delivering results.

I highly recommend Dmitry and would be happy to answer any additional questions.

Sincerely,
