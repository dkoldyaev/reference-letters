From 2019 to 2021, I worked with Dmitry at Tochka Bank, where he held the position of Frontend Developer. Dmitry proved himself to be a responsible and professional specialist you can always rely on.

One of Dmitry's key tasks was the development and maintenance of a UI Kit used across dozens of microfrontends. Together with the team, he worked on creating automated tests — both unit and screenshot tests — which achieved full code coverage. This significantly improved the reliability and stability of the entire system, even with regular changes.

Dmitry also worked closely with our design team. Thanks to his ability to communicate effectively and understand designers' needs, the process of aligning and implementing changes became faster and more efficient. His contributions were particularly notable in the development of our design system.

Another important project was the creation of a grading system for frontend developers. Dmitry participated in both the development and implementation of this system, which made the evaluation process transparent and clear. This system was later adapted for other development disciplines.

Dmitry confidently handled all types of tasks — from routine ones to highly complex and non-standard challenges. His work was always marked by quality and attention to detail.
