To Whom It May Concern,

From 2015 to 2019, Dmitry worked at URA.RU as a FullStack Developer. During this time, he established himself as a highly qualified specialist with deep technical knowledge, outstanding work ethic, and the ability to effectively solve complex tasks.

Dmitry made a significant contribution to the development of our company by successfully implementing several key projects:

- Created a system for cache cleaning and warming, which significantly improved the site's performance.
- As a Frontend Developer, he contributed to updating the client-side of the website on Angular. He developed new functionality, systematized the codebase and data loading processes, and, in cooperation with the design department, led a complete redesign of the website.
- Organized the migration of hundreds of thousands of articles to a new data format, fully preserving existing SEO metrics, which helped us maintain high rankings in search results.
- Introduced an article versioning system that minimized errors and provided editors and journalists with a clear history of changes.

Dmitry not only demonstrated exceptional professionalism but also showed a high level of responsibility, attention to detail, and a creative approach to problem-solving. His contribution to the development of our platform was key to achieving stable and high performance.

We highly value the time and effort Dmitry dedicated to his work at our company and confidently recommend him as a top-tier specialist.
